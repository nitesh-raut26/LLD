## üèõÔ∏è Design Patterns Used

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**
- **Location**: `PricingService` in Ride Sharing, `FineCalculator` in Library
- **Benefit**: Easy to add new pricing strategies (surge pricing, discounts)
- **Implementation**: Interchangeable pricing algorithms

### 2. **Observer Pattern**
- **Location**: Order status updates in Food Delivery, Game events in Snake & Ladder
- **Benefit**: Loose coupling between components, real-time notifications
- **Implementation**: Event-driven status changes

### 3. **Factory Pattern**
- **Location**: Vehicle creation, Seat generation in Movie Booking
- **Benefit**: Centralized object creation, easy to extend
- **Implementation**: Abstract factories for different object types

### 4. **State Pattern**
- **Location**: Booking status in Movie system, Game status in Snake & Ladder
- **Benefit**: Clean state transitions, behavior changes with state
- **Implementation**: Enum-based state management

### 5. **Command Pattern**
- **Location**: Move execution in games, Transaction processing
- **Benefit**: Undo/redo capabilities, move history tracking
- **Implementation**: Encapsulated operations

## üìà Scalability Features

### For 10,000+ Concurrent Users

#### **Database Layer**
```java
// Connection pooling for high concurrency
DatabaseConnectionPool pool = new DatabaseConnectionPool(100);
Repository<Ride, String> rideRepo = new JdbcRepository<>(pool, Ride.class, "rides");
```

#### **Caching Strategy**
```java
// Redis caching for frequent data
CacheService cache = new CacheService("localhost", 6379);
cache.put("driver:location:" + driverId, location, 60); // 1-minute TTL
```

#### **Asynchronous Processing**
```java
// Non-blocking operations with CompletableFuture
public CompletableFuture<Ride> requestRideAsync(String riderId, Location pickup, Location drop) {
    return CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> {
        // Process ride request asynchronously
        return processRideRequest(riderId, pickup, drop);
    }, executorService);
}
```

#### **Load Balancing**
```java
// Multiple service instances
LoadBalancer loadBalancer = new LoadBalancer();
loadBalancer.addInstance(new ServiceInstance("service-1", 8080));
loadBalancer.addInstance(new ServiceInstance("service-2", 8081));
```

#### **Rate Limiting**
```java
// Token bucket rate limiting
RateLimiter rateLimiter = new RateLimiter(1000, 60000); // 1000 req/min
if (rateLimiter.isAllowed(userId)) {
    // Process request
}
```

## üí° Interview Tips

### **When Asked About Design Patterns**
1. **Point to specific classes**: "We use Strategy pattern in `PricingService` for flexible pricing"
2. **Explain business benefit**: "This allows us to easily add surge pricing without changing core logic"
3. **Show extensibility**: "New pricing strategies can be plugged in at runtime"

### **When Discussing Scalability**
1. **Database**: "We use connection pooling and read replicas for 10,000+ users"
2. **Caching**: "Redis caching reduces database load by 80%"
3. **Async Processing**: "Message queues handle non-blocking operations"
4. **Load Balancing**: "Multiple instances distribute traffic"

### **When Talking About SOLID Principles**
1. **SRP**: "`ParkingRate` only calculates rates, `ParkingLot` only manages spots"
2. **OCP**: "Adding new vehicle types doesn't require modifying existing code"
3. **DIP**: "Services depend on interfaces, not concrete implementations"

### **Common Follow-up Questions**
1. **"How would you handle 1 million users?"**
   - Answer: Microservices, database sharding, CDN, caching layers
2. **"What if a service goes down?"**
   - Answer: Circuit breakers, health checks, failover mechanisms
3. **"How do you ensure data consistency?"**
   - Answer: ACID transactions, eventual consistency, saga pattern
